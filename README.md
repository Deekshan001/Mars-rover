# Path Finding
This is a path finding visualizer to help the mars rover(s) navigate, and find shortest path to the destination(s).

# Algorithms used
Dijikstra's Algorithm : guarantees the shortest path
A* search :arguably the best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm.


Add multiple sources/destinations.
Click and drag to add walls or to change the position of start and end nodes. 
(About Drifts)
Add random walls to make it more fun.
